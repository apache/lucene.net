## Git repository

Apache Lucene.Net uses git as its source code management system.

The official repository is here: **[https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=lucenenet.git](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=lucenenet.git)**.

You can clone the repo with the command line or your favorite Git client, example:

```
git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/lucenenet.git
```

There also is a mirror at GitHub **[https://github.com/apache/lucene.net](https://github.com/apache/lucene.net)** which is synced from the Apache repository.

Most work currently happens on the branch named **branch_4x**.
