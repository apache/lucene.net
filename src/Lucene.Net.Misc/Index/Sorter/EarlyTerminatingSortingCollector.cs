    /// <para>
    /// <b>NOTE:</b> the <see cref="Collector"/> detects sorted segments according to
    /// <see cref="SortingMergePolicy"/>, so it's best used in conjunction with it. Also,
    /// it collects up to a specified <see cref="numDocsToCollect"/> from each segment, 
    /// and therefore is mostly suitable for use in conjunction with collectors such as
    /// <see cref="Search.TopDocsCollector{T}"/>, and not e.g. <see cref="TotalHitCountCollector"/>.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>NOTE</b>: If you wrap a <see cref="Search.TopDocsCollector{T}"/> that sorts in the same
    /// order as the index order, the returned <see cref="TopDocsCollector{T}.TopDocs">TopDocs</see>
    /// will be correct. However the total of <see cref="TopDocsCollector{T}.TotalHits"/>
    /// hit count will be underestimated since not all matching documents will have
    /// been collected.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>NOTE</b>: This <see cref="Collector"/> uses <see cref="Sort.ToString()"/> to detect

    /// <li>if a custom comparator is not implemented correctly and returns
    /// different identifiers for equivalent instances, this collector will not
    /// detect sorted segments,</li>
    /// <li>if you suddenly change the <see cref="IndexWriter"/>'s
    /// <see cref="SortingMergePolicy"/> to sort according to another criterion and if both
